# Custom Dropdown React Component

## Introduction:
This project is a custom dropdown component built using ReactJS and React router. The dropdown is designed to mimic the functionality of the browser's native dropdown, with the added ability to select a country first and then select the state. The submit button is disabled until both the country and state have been selected.

## Installation:

 - Clone the project from the Github repository.
 - Install dependencies by running npm install.
 - Start the development server by running npm start.
 - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the dropdown component in the browser.
 
### Usage:

1. Click on the dropdown to view the available options.
2. Select a country from the dropdown list.
3. If a state dropdown is available for the selected country, it will appear below the country dropdown.
4. Select a state from the state dropdown.
5. The submit button will be enabled when both a country and state have been selected.
6. Click the submit button to navigate to the next page.

### Conclusion:
The custom dropdown component is a useful tool for selecting options in a form or application. The ability to select a country first and then a state is a valuable feature that improves the user experience. With a few modifications, this component can be customized to fit the specific needs of any project.
